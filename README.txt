Set the working directory to the root folder.

The simulation is built by using the assigned make file.

To construct the simulation, enter the following in the command window:

  $ make Simulation

(note the upper-case 'S').

This will create the application file 'Simulation', which can be run
by entering the command:

  $ ./Simulation

(note the upper-case 'S').

Once the application has begun, enter the name of the source file, which
should have been placed in the current working directory, and press enter.
This will run both simulations and output the desired results.
